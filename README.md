# Pandas Python Project

This project utilizes Pandas library in Python to analyze sales data from a CSV file. The code performs several analyses to derive insights from the data.

## Analyses Performed:

### 1. Find the Best Month for Sales
The code identifies the month with the highest sales revenue and displays the earnings of that month.

### 2. Identify the City with the Most Sales
It determines the city with the highest total sales and displays the sales figure for that city.

### 3. Determine the Best Time for Advertisement
The code analyzes the distribution of sales throughout the day to suggest the optimal times for displaying advertisements.

### 4. Discover Products Frequently Sold Together
It identifies the products that are commonly sold together and presents the top 5 combinations along with their sales frequency.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed: Pandas, Matplotlib.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script with the CSV file containing sales data (`data.csv` in this case).

## Results:
The code provides valuable insights into sales patterns, enabling better decision-making for marketing strategies, inventory management, and more.
